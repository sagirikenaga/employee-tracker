# Module 12 Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was built to design a library that stores information on specific departments within the company, including the department name, the roles within each department with its corresponding department and salary, and lastly, the employees informations with their roles and their respective managers. When ran through NODE.js, a menu appears that allows the user to choose from a list of options. The user is able to access what is stored in the database, as well as add new information (new departments, roles and employees) and update them. This project was built so that the user can easily keep track of a company's departments. This project allowed for me to apply my knowledge learned about sql2, the inquirer package and the jest package, to apply to earlier concepts throughout the course.

## Installation

Clone/fork this repository at https://github.com/sagirikenaga/employee-tracker. Then, run the command: npm i. Next, log into the sql database by running the command: mysql -u root -p, then inputting in your password. Within the sql database, run the commands db/schema.sql and db/seeds.sql to set the database and seed the data. Lastly, run the command: npm start. The prompt menu will appear and the user may simply use the keyboard to select from various options. 

## Usage

This project is used by accessing the code through NODE, and using the prompt menu to select their desired option. The user may view the departments, roles, and employees within the company with their corresponding information. There are also options to add to each section, as well as update an employee's role. When finished, the user may simply select "exit" to exit out of the application.
